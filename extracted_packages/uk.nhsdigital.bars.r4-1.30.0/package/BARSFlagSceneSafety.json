It usually represents something of sufficient significance to warrant a special display of some sort - rather than just a note in the resource. A flag has a subject representing the resource that will trigger its display.\r\n\r\nThis subject can be of different types, as described in the examples below:\r\n\r\n- A note that a patient has an overdue account, which the provider may wish to discuss with them - in case of hardship for example (subject = Patient)\r\n- An outbreak of Ebola in a particular region (subject=Location) so that all patients from that region have a higher risk of having that condition\r\n- A particular provider is unavailable for referrals over a given period (subject = Practitioner)\r\n- A patient who is enrolled in a clinical trial (subject=Group)\r\n- Special guidance or caveats to be aware of when following a protocol (subject=PlanDefinition)\r\n- Warnings about using a drug in a formulary requires special approval (subject=Medication)\r\n- etc.","copyright":"Copyright © 2021+ HL7 UK Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
